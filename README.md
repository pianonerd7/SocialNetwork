Social_Network
==============
This project consists of users, links, and socialNetworks. The links connect two users, and each user can connect to any user, 
but cannot be connected to the same user twice. SocialNetwork is a huge network of users, in which users may or may not be 
connected. The neighborhood method in socialNetwork returns all friend users and the distance. And the neighborhood trend method
in socialNetwork returns all the dates and the size of the neighborhood at that given time.
